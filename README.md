====================

Nameless Boilerplate

This project is to take the "nameless" theme and integrate it with HTML 5
boilerplate, to make a responsive theme. 

Based on / including code from:

1. The Nameless WordPress theme: http://koch-werkstatt.de/2010/03/21/wordpress-theme-nameless/

2. HTML 5 Boilerplate: http://html5boilerplate.com/
	Which itself includes: 
		- modernizr 2.5.3: http://modernizr.com/
		- jQuery (but I stripped that out as WordPress already includes it)
		
3. Responsive WordPress core styles: http://jeffsebring.com/responsive-wordpress-images/
